Teach Me to Walk in the Light
The Light Divine
God's Daily Care
In Our Lovely Deseret
Love One Another
As Sisters in Zion
A Key Was Turned in Latter Days
We Meet Again As Sisters
We Ever Pray For Thee
God Is Love
How Gentle God's Commands
Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee
The Lord Is My Shepherd
Sweet Is the Work
Love at Home
Ye Elders of Israel
The Priesthood of Our Lord
Ye Who Are Called to Labor
Come, All Ye Sons of God
Rise Up, O Men of God
Rise Up, O Men of God
See The Mighty Priesthood Gathered
Come, Come Ye Saints
Go, Ye Messengers of Heaven
An Angel From on High
Thy Servants Are Prepared
See, The Mighty Angel Flying
Oh Say, What Is Truth?
Come, O Thou Kings of Kings
High on the Mountain Top
I Need Thee Every Hour
Brightly Beams Our Father's Mercy
School Thy Feelings
O Home Beloved
America the Beautiful
My Country, 'Tis of Thee/My Country 'Tis of Thee
The Star-Spangled Banner
God Save The King
